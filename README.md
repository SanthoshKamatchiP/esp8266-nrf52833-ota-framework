esp8266-nrf52833-ota-bridge
ESP8266-based OTA firmware updater for nRF52833 using UART communication. The ESP8266 downloads firmware over WiFi and transfers it to the nRF52833 for remote firmware updates.

ESP8266 – nRF52833 OTA Bridge
Project Vision
The vision of this project is to build a lightweight and flexible firmware update bridge that enables remote firmware updates for embedded devices. The system uses an ESP8266 WiFi module as a gateway to download firmware from the internet and transfer it to an nRF52833 device using UART communication.

This approach allows firmware updates without requiring a direct internet connection on the target microcontroller.

Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a reliable firmware update mechanism where:

The ESP8266 connects to WiFi
Firmware is downloaded from a server
The firmware is stored temporarily in ESP8266 flash memory
The ESP8266 transfers firmware to nRF52833 via UART
The nRF52833 updates its internal flash
This design enables remote firmware updates (OTA-style) for devices that do not have direct WiFi capability.
